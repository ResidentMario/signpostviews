    "# Signpost Article Views\n",
    "\n",
    "We on the editorial board of the *Wikipedia Signpost* have wanted for a while now to run statistics on the page views that our stories generate. Understanding our distribution helps us understand our readership, and understanding our readership helps us to direct our energies in our future writing towards the stories that our readers most want to see and read. Distribution management is a basic tenet of newspaper management (I know of at least one \"recovering academic\" working in circulation analytics at *The New York Times*), but unfortunately one we've never quite been able to do before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past the only way to get ever-popular pageview statistics was to use [stats.grok.se](http://stats.grok.se/), a venerable website run by an involved community member which did define an API for query but which, alas, didn't have the throughput to serve the results in reasonable time. It relied on huge database dumps which are a pain to download, let alone parse. Finally (belatedly) acting on this fact, the Wikimedia Foundation in December 2015 [rolled out a full-suite Pageview RESTBase API](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/12/14/pageview-data-easily-accessible/) getting view statistics on pages on Wikipedia has become worlds easier, especially with the R and Python API clients also released for the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: The dataset for this analysis is the set of all *Signpost* article views from the period 2015-10-07 to 2015-12-30. The *Wikipedia Signpost* is published on a weekly basis (and has been since its inception in 2005): this period saw 12 publications (one issue was skipped around Christmas-time). We would like to extend the analysis further back, but due to differing standard of reporting in older applications and logs, for the moment early October 2015 is the earliest date for which Pageview API data is available."

Since many will have originally read it there first anyway, this is likely the least popular section, just as a matter of course.\n",
    "* The \"Gallery\" section is a composition of images, either from photo competitions or from meetups or, occasionally, just to go with the season.\n",
    "* The \"Blog\" section selectively republished reports first posted the [Wikimedia Blog](http://blog.wikimedia.org/).\n",
    "* The \"Traffic report\" speculates on the popularity of the top ten most popular articles on Wikipedia of the week. It is light-hearted material that is well-read for what it is.\n",
    "* \"Recent research\" (also compiled separately as the [Recent Research report](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Newsletter)) is a monthly section which summarizes the state of academic research on Wikipedia and the Wikimedias. It is thus a dense read, for good reason!\n",
    "* The \"Arbitration report\" summarizes the outcomes and progress in cases took on by the [Arbitration Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee), the community court of last resort.\n",
    "* The \"WikiProject report\" interviews the active members of a WikiProject such a WikiProject Volcanoes or WikiProject Iceland.\n",
    "* \"In the media\" summarizes the week's media mentions of Wikipedia and the Wikimedia movement.\n",
    "* \"News and notes\" summarizes the week's internal news specific to the operations of the encyclopedia and the Wikimedia movement.\n",
    "* \"Opinion\" is when someone sticks their nose out and stakes a case in the *Signpost*, arguing for or against something. It's no wonder it's well-read!\n",
    "* The \"Special report\" is a well-researched *Signpost* inside scoop on something of the project, and is a report which is more just-the-facts than an opinion column."

The **news cycle** is almost-but-not-quite-weekly accumulation of goings-on that is covered in each *Signpost* issue - that is, the space between one issue and the next. The *Signpost* is variably published usually a day or two late in order to accomadate the schedules of the publishers and also to best fit whatever the current news cycle may be, and so as a result the **post date** that each issue is labelled with (`2015-10-07`, for instance) is very rarely the actual **publication date** (which was `2015-10-09` in this example case).\n",
