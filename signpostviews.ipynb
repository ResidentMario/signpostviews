    "# Signpost Article Views\n",
    "\n",
    "We on the editorial board of the *Wikipedia Signpost* have wanted for a while now to run statistics on the page views that our stories generate. Understanding our distribution helps us understand our readership, and understanding our readership helps us to direct our energies in our future writing towards the storis that our readers most want to see and read. Distribution management is a basic tenet of newspaper management (I know of at least one \"recovering academic\" working in circulation analytics at *The New York Times*), but unfortunately one we've never quite been able to do before.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past the only way to get ever-popular pageview statistics was to use [stats.grok.se](http://stats.grok.se/), a venerable website run by an involved community member which did define an API for query but which, alas, didn't have the throughput to serve the results in reasonable time. It relied on huge database dumps which are a pain to download, let alone parse. Finally (belatedly) acting on this fact, the Wikimedia Foundation in December 2015 [rolled out a full-suite Pageview RESTBase API](http://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/12/14/pageview-data-easily-accessible/) getting view statistics on pages on Wikipedia has become worlds easier, especially with the R and Python API clients also released for the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: The dataset for this analysis is the set of all *Signpost* article views from the period 2015-10-07 to 2015-12-30. The *Wikipedia Signpost* is published on a weekly basis (and has been since its inception in 2005): this period saw 12 publications (one issue was skipped around Christmas-time). We would like to extend the analysis further back, but due to differing standard of reporting in older applications and logs, for the moment early October 2015 is the earliest date for which Pageview API data is available."

Since many will have originally read it there first anyway, this is likely the least popular section, just as a matter of course.\n",

The **news cycle** is almost-but-not-quite-weekly accumulation of goings-on that is covered in each *Signpost* issue - that is, the space between one issue and the next. Views are considered to be **in-cycle** if they occur while that issue is the current one.\n",
